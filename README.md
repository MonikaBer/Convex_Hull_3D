# Convex_Hull_3D
Implementation of 3 algorithms (Incremental Hull, Gift Wrapping, Naive) to determine the convex hull for a set of points in 3D space. It is in order to measure and compare the running times of these algorithms.
Sets of points are generated by three types of generators: sphere, ball and cuboid generator, which are generate points in 3D spaces. Size of points sets is determined by user.

The project also includes a simple visualizer of solutions.

## Tools
