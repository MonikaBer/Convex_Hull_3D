# Convex_Hull_3D
Implementation of 3 algorithms (Incremental Hull, Gift Wrapping, Naive) to determine the convex hull for a set of points in 3D space. It is in order to measure and compare the running times of these algorithms.

The project also includes a simple solution visualizer.

## Tools
Java 11 (without Garbage Collector), Swing, Maven 

## Usage
```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/project-1.0.0.jar
```
